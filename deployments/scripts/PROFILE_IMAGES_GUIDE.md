# Profile Images Guide for 75Flow Production

## Overview
This guide explains how profile images work in 75Flow and how to ensure they display correctly in production.

## Current Status
✅ **Local Development**: Profile images work correctly  
✅ **Production**: Profile images should now work with the updated configuration  
✅ **Files**: All profile images are properly stored in `media/profile_images/`

## How Profile Images Work

### **Local Development**
- Django serves media files directly from the `media/` directory
- Profile images are stored in `media/profile_images/`
- URLs are served as `/media/profile_images/filename.png`

### **Production (Railway)**
- Media files are now served by Django in production (updated configuration)
- Files are stored in the same `media/` directory structure
- URLs work the same way as in development

## Profile Images Found
Based on the migration check, these profile images exist:

1. **Shruti**: `media/profile_images/Shruti_5lA8J6j.png`
2. **Sid**: `media/profile_images/Sanjh_TaGqpy0.png` 
3. **Sanju**: `media/profile_images/Sanjh.png`

## Configuration Changes Made

### **1. Updated Django Settings (`flow75/settings.py`)**
```python
# Configure media files for production
if ENVIRONMENT == 'production':
    # Use WhiteNoise for static files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'
    
    # For media files in production, configure for Railway
    MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
    MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
    
    # Ensure media directory exists
    MEDIA_ROOT.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
```

### **2. Updated URL Configuration (`flow75/urls.py`)**
```python
# Serve static and media files in development and production
if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
else:
    # In production, still serve media files for now
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```

## Deployment Steps

### **1. Railway Environment Variables**
Make sure these are set in your Railway project:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:fcAwGtxyvfgwpBYpaHNWLLzqXUIoTamM@mainline.proxy.rlwy.net:22310/railway
ENVIRONMENT=production
DEBUG=False
```

### **2. Deploy to Railway**
The changes have been pushed to GitHub. Railway should automatically redeploy.

### **3. Verify Profile Images**
After deployment, check that:
- Profile images load correctly in the profile page
- Images display in the scoreboard
- No broken image icons appear

## Troubleshooting

### **If Images Still Don't Work:**

1. **Check Railway Logs**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Check deployment logs for any errors

2. **Verify File Paths**
   - Ensure profile images are in the correct database records
   - Check that file paths are relative to `media/` directory

3. **Test Image URLs**
   - Try accessing image URLs directly: `your-app.railway.app/media/profile_images/filename.png`

### **Alternative Solutions**

If the current approach doesn't work, consider:

1. **Cloud Storage (Recommended for Production)**
   - Use AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or similar
   - More reliable and scalable for production

2. **Base64 Encoding**
   - Store images as base64 strings in the database
   - Works but increases database size

3. **CDN Integration**
   - Use a CDN for serving images
   - Better performance and reliability

## File Structure
```
75Flow/
├── media/
│   └── profile_images/
│       ├── Shruti_5lA8J6j.png
│       ├── Sanjh_TaGqpy0.png
│       └── Sanjh.png
├── static/
│   └── images/
│       └── default_avatar.png
└── templates/
    └── habits/
        └── profile.html
```

## Testing

### **Local Testing**
```bash
# Run the profile image check
python3 migrate_profile_images.py

# Start development server
python3 manage.py runserver 8000
```

### **Production Testing**
1. Visit your Railway app URL
2. Log in and go to profile page
3. Check if profile images display correctly
4. Verify images work in scoreboard and other pages

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor**: Check if profile images work after deployment
2. **Optimize**: Consider implementing cloud storage for better reliability
3. **Backup**: Ensure profile images are backed up regularly
4. **Performance**: Monitor image loading performance in production

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Railway deployment logs
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test image URLs directly
4. Consider implementing cloud storage solution
